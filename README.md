# A development container for Haskell

This is an opinionated [Dev Container](https://containers.dev) for Haskell.

![GIF showing the development container in use](./docs/example.gif)

## Features

The development container has the following features:

- **Pre-configured Cabal, Stack and HLS:** Cabal, Stack and HLS come pre-installed and pre-configured.
- **Pre-installed development tools:** The development container comes with a number of generic (Git, Neovim, SSH, etc.) and Haskell-specific (ormolu, implicit-hie, retrie, etc.) development tools pre-installed.
- **Integrated GHCi:** The development container comes with an integrated GHCi shell.
- **Offline support:** Hoogle and Hackage are included locally in the container, meaning you do not need an internet connection to find definitions or read documentation.

To open the integrated GHCi shell, press the yellow lambda symbol in the top-right corner. To search Hoogle, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>.

## Using with Visual Studio Code

Follow the steps below to use the Dev Container with Visual Studio Code:

1. Follow the [Getting Started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_getting-started) instructions to configure Visual Studio Code and Docker for use with Dev Containers.
2. Copy the `.devcontainer` folder in this repository to the root of your project. You can checkout another branch to use a different version (the default branch is the latest version for which a devcontainer exists).
3. Reload the project by opening the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and executing the command `>Reload Window` or by closing and re-opening Visual Studio Code.
4. Click `Reopen in Container` when Visual Studio Code prompts you (see image below), or by opening the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and executing the command `>Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.

> [!WARNING]
> Building the devcontainer initially may take a **long time** (30 minutes to multiple hours).

## How does it work

Visual Studio Code supports [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) (i.e. using a Docker image as a development environment). It automates the hassle of setting up a proper development environment.

## Troubleshooting

This section lists some common problems, and possible ways to fix these problems. If you encounter an issue not listed here, or if the fixes listed do not work for you, please [open an issue](https://github.com/marijnvanwezel/haskell-dev-env/issues/new).
